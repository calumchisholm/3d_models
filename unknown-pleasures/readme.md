**CP 1919 pulsar signal**
This model recreates the pulsar signal that famously appears on Joy Division's [Unknown Pleasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures) album cover.

It is based on the `CP 1919 / PSR B1919+21` Dataset found at [r-bloggers.com](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2024/06/cp-1919-psr-b191921-dataset/),
though this is not its original source.

For simplicity, the values used in this model have all been offset to avoid any negative heights.
