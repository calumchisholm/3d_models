**Updated Webcam Mount for T-Slot/V-Slot Frames**

This redesigned model replaces the original `webcam_mount.stl` found in the Genius FaceCam 1000X mount for 40x40 aluminum extrusion project:

The new design supports T-slot and V-slot frames, making it compatible with a wider range of 3D printers â€” especially those where the ends of the extrusions are not accessible, such as the Elegoo Neptune series.
